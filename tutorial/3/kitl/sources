#           OAL and kernel
#
# nkstub  : translation library for kernel functions so their
#           legacy names can be used
#
# oemstub : translation library for OAL functions so their
#           legacy names can be used
#
# oal_kitl: the platform\common kitl support library, the
#           name oal is only there for legacy purposes.  This
#           library is unrelated to the OAL.
#
# kitl_log: the platform\common kitl debug message library
#
# kitleth_platcom :
#           the platform-common compatible ethernet transport
#           library we built in the ethdrv directory
