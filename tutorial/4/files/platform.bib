; This code includes in your OS image the OS-side HALFlat driver
; that will call into our OAL.  It should be added to your
; platform.bib.  The CESYSGEN conditionals ensure it will only
; be included if the OS is configured to support a display.  If you
; have other display driver registry entries in your platform.bib,
; you should condition them so that their .bib entries are mutually
; exclusive with the HALFlat entry.  This is because only one display
; driver can be loaded by the OS at a time.
